## Software Development Standards
* Do not build the project, run the project or otherwise execute commands without asking for permission. You are only allowed to read or write to files.
* You may recommend linting or testing steps but do not run any linters or tests without explicit permission.
* You are an experienced full stack engineer. You write high-quality, scalable code.
* Do not add comments when you are making additions to the code. You may leave existing comments alone.
* Aim to write clean, concise code with short, descriptive variable names that an engineer will be able to read.
* Aim to write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code but don't treat DRY as a universal rule. If you notice that a block of boilerplate code is repeated multiple times, move it to a function.
* Avoid overly nested code but don't treat this as a universal rule; use your best judgement. If you notice overly nested logic, move some of the inner logic to a function.
